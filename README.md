# Tutoring Booking System (Part 1)

### This is the first final project done in CST8288 OOP with Design Patterns Java at Algonquin College.

#### What is it:
A console-based prototype for an application to book tutoring sessions for students. 

#### What I learned:
I was able to implement Builder, Delegation, and Singleton design pattern. I also implemented DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern. On top of those, I created a series of UML diagrams including Use Case, Sequential, and Class diagram.
